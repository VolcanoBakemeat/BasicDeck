# BasicDeck
A basic deck program.
 A little more information about this project: the final goal of this is to create a card game, similar in some ways to Apples to Apples. In the final version, each card will have the name of a fictional character. During each hand, judge will put down a card. Then the other players will put down the character card in their hand that they believe would make the best couple with the judges card. Meanwhile in meatspace, the players will argue for their cards. Once the judge chooses the winner, that point is stored and the winner becomes the new judge. Additionaly the card structure will have a value corresponding to the book/movie/whatever the character came from, and the program will only deal cards from books/movies/whatevers that the players say they've seen.
